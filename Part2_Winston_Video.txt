PART 2: WINSTON VIDEO - "How to Speak"
========================================

Five examples of Winston's advice that I plan to follow in presenting my Final Project:

1. START WITH A CYCLE (The "Promise" Technique)
-------------------------------------------------
Winston emphasizes starting presentations with a promise of what the audience 
will learn, then delivering on that promise, and finally summarizing what was 
learned.

MY APPLICATION:
I will start my presentation by promising: "By the end of this presentation, 
you will understand how KeyChord demonstrates professional MVC architecture, 
SOLID principles, and comprehensive testing in a real-world Java application."

Then I will deliver on this promise by walking through the architecture, 
demonstrating each principle with code examples, and showing test coverage.

Finally, I will summarize: "We've seen how KeyChord uses MVC separation, 
SOLID principles, and design patterns to create maintainable, testable code."


2. USE TIME AND PLACE TO BUILD A FENCE (Distinguish Your Work)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Winston advises using "time and place" to distinguish your work from others' 
work - building a "fence" around your contribution.

MY APPLICATION:
I will clearly distinguish KeyChord's approach:
- "Unlike simple piano apps that mix UI and logic, KeyChord strictly separates 
  Model, View, and Controller with zero dependencies between layers."
- "While many projects use fixed track systems, KeyChord uses a flexible 
  RecordingManager that can handle unlimited named recordings."
- "KeyChord demonstrates advanced OOD principles not just in structure, but 
  in practical application - every design decision serves a purpose."


3. USE PROPS AND DEMONSTRATIONS (Show, Don't Just Tell)
--------------------------------------------------------
Winston emphasizes the power of props and live demonstrations to engage the 
audience and make concepts concrete.

MY APPLICATION:
I will:
- Live-demo the application: play notes, record, play back, export MIDI
- Show the keyboard highlighting during playback to demonstrate visual 
  synchronization
- Display the code structure in IDE to show MVC separation
- Run unit tests live to demonstrate test coverage
- Show the class diagram while explaining relationships

This makes abstract OOD principles concrete and memorable.


4. TELL A STORY (Narrative Structure)
--------------------------------------
Winston recommends using narrative structure - setting up a problem, showing 
the journey to solve it, and revealing the solution.

MY APPLICATION:
I will structure my presentation as a story:
- "The Challenge: Building a piano app that's both functional and well-designed"
- "The Journey: How we applied MVC to separate concerns, SOLID principles to 
  ensure maintainability, and design patterns to solve specific problems"
- "The Solution: KeyChord - a professional application demonstrating all these 
  principles working together"
- "The Result: Clean, testable, extensible code that can grow with new features"

This narrative structure makes the presentation engaging and memorable.


5. USE THE BOARD EFFECTIVELY (Visual Communication)
----------------------------------------------------
Winston emphasizes using visual aids (board, slides) to reinforce verbal 
communication, not replace it.

MY APPLICATION:
I will use slides/board to:
- Show the MVC architecture diagram while explaining separation of concerns
- Display code snippets highlighting specific OOD principles (e.g., "Here's 
  how we use the Strategy pattern in ChordManager")
- Show the class diagram while explaining relationships
- Display test coverage metrics while discussing testing strategy
- Use color coding to highlight different layers (Model=blue, View=green, 
  Controller=yellow)

Each visual will reinforce what I'm saying verbally, not just repeat it.


BONUS: Additional Winston Principles I Will Apply
---------------------------------------------------

6. SPEAK WITH ENTHUSIASM
I will demonstrate genuine enthusiasm for the project - showing how OOD 
principles solve real problems and make code better.

7. HANDLE QUESTIONS GRACEFULLY
I will prepare for common questions (e.g., "Why MVC?", "Why not use inheritance 
here?") and answer them by referring back to OOD principles.

8. PRACTICE TIMING
I will practice the presentation to ensure I stay within time limits while 
covering all key points.

9. USE EXAMPLES, NOT JUST ABSTRACTIONS
I will show concrete code examples for each OOD principle, not just describe 
them abstractly.

10. END WITH A STRONG CONCLUSION
I will end by summarizing the key OOD principles demonstrated and how they 
make KeyChord a professional, maintainable application.
