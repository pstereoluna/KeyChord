Elevator Pitch:
Virtual Piano Studio is an interactive Java-based application that transforms digital piano playing into a more engaging and creative experience.
Unlike standard virtual pianos that only play single notes, our system allows users to trigger complete chords with a single click using an intelligent chord-generation engine.
The goal is to make music creation simple and intuitive â€” enabling anyone, even without formal training, to produce rich and expressive piano sounds through an easy-to-use interface.

Rough Draft: Domain Objects / Class Ideas

Note â€“ represents a single musical pitch
Chord â€“ defines groups of notes that form a harmony
ChordFactory â€“ creates chords (Major, Minor, 7th, etc.)
MidiService â€“ manages playback and timing
PianoKey â€“ represents an individual key on the piano GUI
ChordButton â€“ triggers chord playback through the ChordFactory
VirtualPianoUI â€“ provides the graphical interface for user interaction
RecordingManager â€“ handles user recording and playback

Optional Future Extensions:

User-defined chord progressions
MIDI file export
Visual chord diagrams
Learning/Practice mode with feedback
