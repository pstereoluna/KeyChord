Elevator Pitch

Virtual Piano Studio â€” also known as KeyChord â€” is a lightweight Java-based music application that transforms any computer keyboard into a powerful, multi-track music sampler.
We designed it for aspiring musicians, bedroom producers, and hobbyists who want to sketch musical ideas instantly, without needing expensive MIDI controllers or complex software.

Unlike standard virtual pianos that only play single notes, our system lets users trigger full chords and harmonies with one click, turning simple keystrokes into expressive performances.
KeyChord allows you to layer melodies, create loops, and build entire song drafts using only your QWERTY keyboard.

Our goal is to make music creation more accessible and intuitive â€” turning everyday inspiration into a complete composition within seconds. Beyond piano, we plan to incorporate more instruments, so users can create their own instant band and compose freely.

Rough Draft: Domain Objects / Class Ideas

Note â€“ represents a single musical pitch
Chord â€“ defines groups of notes that form a harmony
ChordFactory â€“ creates chords (Major, Minor, 7th, etc.)
MidiService â€“ manages playback and timing
KeyMapper â€“ maps QWERTY keys to specific notes/chords
Track â€“ represents a loop layer for multi-track composition
RecordingManager â€“ records and replays performances
VirtualPianoUI â€“ GUI for visual keyboard and chord triggering

Optional Future Extensions

Multi-instrument support (guitar, bass, drums)
User-defined chord progressions
MIDI file export
Real-time recording and playback visualization
Practice mode with feedback
