Elevator Pitch:
Virtual Piano Studio is an interactive Java-based music application that combines a digital piano with intelligent, style-based accompaniment.
Unlike standard virtual pianos that only play individual notes, our system allows users to trigger complete chords and accompaniment patterns with one click, using a preserved ChordFactory and PlayStyle engine from our previous ‚Äústringless guitar‚Äù design.
Users can choose musical styles such as Pop, Folk, or Jazz, and the system will automatically generate harmonically accurate piano accompaniments.
Our goal is to make music creation more expressive and intuitive, even for those without formal training ‚Äî turning simple interaction into full, rich performances.
