PART 2: WINSTON VIDEO - "How to Speak"
========================================

Five examples of Winston's advice that we plan to follow in presenting our Final Project:

1. THE EMPOWERMENT PROMISE (How to Start)
------------------------------------------
Winston: Start with an empowerment promise - tell the audience what they will know 
at the end that they didn't know at the beginning.

OUR APPLICATION:
We will start with: "Today we're going to show you KeyChord, a virtual piano app 
we built. We'll walk you through how we used MVC architecture, SOLID principles, 
and some design patterns, and show you how they work together in the code."


2. CYCLING (Repetition)
------------------------
Winston: Go around the subject three times. ~20% of the audience is "fogged out" 
at any moment, so repetition ensures everyone gets it.

OUR APPLICATION:
We will cycle through MVC three times: overview, detailed examples, then synthesis.


3. BUILDING A FENCE (Distinguish Your Work)
---------------------------------------------
Winston: Distinguish your idea from others using "time and place."

OUR APPLICATION:
We will distinguish KeyChord by emphasizing strict MVC separation with zero 
cross-layer dependencies, and how every design decision serves a purpose.


4. USE PROPS AND DEMONSTRATIONS
--------------------------------
Winston: Props work through empathetic mirroring. When you handle a physical 
object, the audience's mirror neurons fire.

OUR APPLICATION:
We will live-demo the application (play, record, playback, export MIDI), show 
keyboard highlighting during playback, display code structure in IDE, and run 
unit tests to demonstrate test coverage.


5. HOW TO STOP (Final Slide)
-----------------------------
Winston: The final slide should show Contributions, not "Thank you" or "The End."

OUR APPLICATION:
FINAL SLIDE - "Contributions":
- Demonstrated strict MVC architecture with zero cross-layer dependencies
- Applied all five SOLID principles in a practical application
- Implemented three design patterns (Singleton, Strategy, Adapter)
- Achieved comprehensive unit test coverage
- Created a functional virtual piano with recording and MIDI export

FINAL WORDS:
Instead of "Thank you," we will say: "We've enjoyed sharing KeyChord with you. 
We value your feedback, and we look forward to discussing how these OOD principles 
can be applied to other projects."
